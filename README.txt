This is a simulation for the Series60 catamaran 
at Fn 0.30, s/L 0.388 and Fixed Trim condition.

The mesh is by no means optimum. But the results 
do agree with the experimental ones with acceptable 
levels of accuracy. For higher Fn the results become 
more accurate. This was just a rough start for 
a series of simulations.

Thank you!!!
